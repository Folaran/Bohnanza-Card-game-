# Bohnanza (work in progress)
This card game is a variation of Bohnanza, a German-style card game of trading and politics, designed by Uwe Rosenberg. Two players place cads in chains, trade the cards and sell the chains. The cards have 8 different faces corresponding to semi-precious and precious gemstones. The goal of the game is to chain-up the cards of equal gemstones to gain coins. The player with the most coins at the end wins.
